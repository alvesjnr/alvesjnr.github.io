Astrophotography is one of my hobbies. It combines a few of my passions such as Physics (or astronomy, to be precise), optics (I have a Ph.D. in Photonics) and data processing, which I use heavilly in the postprocessing of my photos.

All photos seen here taken by me, ususally from my backyard.

I'm shooting with either a 80mm f6 triplet or a 6" RC. At the time this text was written, my camera was a ZWO 533mc and my mount an iOptron gem28.

My postprocessing is done with a combination of Pixinsight and custom made scripts, usually written in Python, but sometimes in Rust just for the fun.
